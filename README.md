Project to assess the eligibility of an agent for exemption (curently for MTEL).

This will need to be refined, reread for accuracy, and rebranded: purpose is to demonstrate the vision of the flow.

Opportunity:
- Could be used for other Ministries for the PSC (same rules)
- Could serve as a basis for Enterprise (based on Contract type I guess)

What it solves for:
- Agent can easily follow the steps to discover on their own if they are eligible for a dispense
- No need to contact Care (hope to decrease the contact rate for Public sector around exemption)
- Scale very well for future contracts
- Lowlift (I think) to implement in our onboarding/exemption flow
